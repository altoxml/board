<b>Minutes</b>

<p>
New board member Ralph Marschall, National Library of Luxembourg welcomed. Ralph responds that he is happy to join the board and is responsible for digital projects at the Library.
</p>
<p>    
Nate Trail and Frederick, whose terms expire 31 December 2017, affirmed that they will continue as ALTO board member.  Siang Hock will not continue as a board member.    
</p>
<p>
Introductory jokes are not recorded :-)
</p>
<p>
Clemens leads the board in selecting a new board chair.  Frederick says that he will act as board chair for another year (2018) but will step down as board chair. No one else volunteers to serve as board chair, but Jukka, Stefan, Jean-Phillipe, and Art should also be asked their interest in becoming board chair.  Clemens volunteers to ask Jukka, Stefan, Jean-Phillipe, and Art.  A genda item 4 to be carried over to the next board meeting.
</p> 
<p>
wrt to agenda Raju added an example of a right-to-left language to the github repository for reference examples. Clemens has added 
examples from the Berlin library, too. Ashok will upload out-of-copyright images for Google's stock of images for OCR test, Cherokee,
East Asian languages with text left to right and up to down.  Google has document (book, etc) images as well as "seen" text.  Clemens
reports that the Berlin library has Turkish language in Arabic script and Church Slavonic.
</p>
<p>
Clemens and Raju agree that a repository for these reference images; Clemens will create the repository.  Frederick mentions that 
such a repository might be useful for the ICDAR competitions.  Clemens says that IAPR Technical Committee 10 might also be
interested in these images, too.  Clemens will get in touch with IAPR to find out what is needed to register a data set in TC-11.
</p>
<p>
Agenda item 9: rederick reports that neither he nor Jean-Phillipe have finished submission of ALTO as a MIME type to IETF as a RFC.
</p>
<p>
Agenda item 6: Evelien reports that Joachim, Stefan, and Clemens agreed to review the README and the changes for ALTO schema 4.0 
but have not yet done so.  Evelien will remind them to do this before the next board meeting.  Evelien says that she will update 
the README for the new release too.
</p>
<p>
Raju reports briefly on agenda item 7, examples of text direction for Asian languages. He explains that both board and non-board 
members should contribute to it. Clemens explains that non-board members - github registered users but without write priveleges 
to the ALTO repository - contribute to the image repository by forking the repository.  Clemens will add a short statement 
explaining this to a README for the repository.  Clemens asks for names for the repository. Ashok suggests that the name of the 
repository should capture the mission of ALTO, namely, to capture OCR text in all its forms, for widely spoken and narrowly spoken, 
and little used languages.
</p>
<p>
Ashok reports that Google now gives attention to text in videos and asks if ALTO should also be capable of representing text from
videos.  Clemens says that ALTO should be capable of doing this and is of the opinion that such capabilities are within the scope of
the ALTO board. Ashok says Google captures text via OCR from videos now and wants some external format in which to put the 
results.  Ashok will upload an out-of-copyright video (mp4) to the aforementioned repository that Clemens will create.
