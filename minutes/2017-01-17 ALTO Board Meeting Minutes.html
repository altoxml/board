<b>Minutes</b>
</p>

<p>
Forgot to record the first minutes of meeting so we start with the registration of MIME type for ALTO.
</p>

<p>
The board agreed to register ALTO as a MIME with IETF.  He will adapt a similar IEFT draft for another MIME type for ALTO.  
Jukka agreed to review Jean Philippe's use of the English language as needed.
</p>
<p>
No discussion of the Glyphs change request because Joachim was meeting at his son's school.
</p>
<p>
An abbreviated discussion of the board's proposed use of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0)</a> for ALTO XML. 
Joachim reported by email the following wrt <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a> for ALTO XML:
<br><br>
<i>I have verified the contractual topic regarding copyright for ALTO and to be safe we at CCS are clarifying with the 4 authors 
	if they all agree to the change to CC BY-SA 4.0, as a former copyright statement was removed on handover to the Library of Congress as demanded. 
	But I have no written agreement of all parties of METAe partnership available.  So I propose to leave this topic pending till next call.</i>
</p>
<p>
A (very) short review of collaboration with the Newspapers Interest Group of the IIIF.  It requests that the ALTO board register a MIME type for ALTO.
</p>
<p>
Jean Philippe asks about a face-to-face meeting for the ALTO board in conjunction with a conference.  Frederick mentioned several conferences; 
he will create a Doodle poll for board members to show their preferences for conference.
