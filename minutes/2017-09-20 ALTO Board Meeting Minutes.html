<b>Minutes</b>
</p>
<p>
Frederick asks Raju if Siang Hock wil continue on the ALTO board.  Raju said that he would ask when he returns to Singapore (Raju is in India at present).
</p>
<p>
Raju said that he give some attention to action item <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/board/issues/4">#4</a> for the next board meeting.  
Jean Philippe reports that he has attended a recent IIIF teleconference.  He also says that it would be a good time to update use cases for IIIF and ALTO 
(see <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/45">issue 45</a>).  Jean Philippe says he is writing an ALTO+IIIF use case for illustrations with Glen Robson, a IIIF guru.  
Jean Philippe mentions the <a href="http://iiif.io/event/2017/toronto/">IIIF Working Meeting</a> in Toronado October 11-13.
</p>
<p>
Frederick reports that the IETF draft document for an ALTO MIME type was reviewed at the Dresden face-to-face meeting.  It is ready to be submitted to IETF.  
Jean Philippe and Frederick will do this before the next board meeting.
</p>
<p>
At the face-to-face meeting we also reviewed the README for ALTO schema 3.2.  It's ready to go.  Nate volunteers to work with Joachim to publish schema version 3.2 before the next board meeting.
</p>
<p>
The board review open issues in the schema repository.  Evelien says we should give attention to <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a>, a bug reported by an ALTO user. 
The bug fix would break backwards compatibility.  Stefan reminds the board that it had a long discussion about changes: for every schema change that breaks backward compatibility will
be a new schema major version.  Jukka wonders if  <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a> also affects glyphs.  Evelien will look at other elements to see if 
<a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a> affects them too.</p>
<p>
The release of ALTO schema version 3.2 is no more. The erstwhile version 3.2 will be renamed to version 4..0 and incorporated with a fix to  <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a>.
Evelien will investigate the necessary changes to fix <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a> and also  see what other schema elements are affected.  
Stefan and Joachim will review the proposed changes.  Evelien will work on the change in time for the next meeting; Stefan and Joachim will review the changes.  The README will be changed to accomodate the 
changes necessary for <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/42">issue 42</a>.
