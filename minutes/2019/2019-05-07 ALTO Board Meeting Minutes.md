**Minutes**

The Board welcomed Ben, David, Gerald and Sebastian to the meeting. After some 
introductions, the group discussed handwriting in depth, as well as options for preserving 
internal uncertainty in OCR processing. This would not only be extremely useful for
the recognition of typeset text but has special significance for handwriting.

There was consensus that handwriting support is a desirable target for the ALTO format
and general agreement that encoding multiple hypotheses within a standard and 
interoperable lattice structure would be valuable. Beneficial use cases include:

   * search/discovery (a rejected word, for example, might match a query and increase probability metrics that a page is relevant)

   * downstream natural language processing

   * deriving OCR confidence values

   * specific outputs based on word/term distributions, such as topic maps

There is a possible candidate lattice format developed at the University of Rostock
connected to the [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu) project. Sebastian may be 
able to liaise with the ALTO Board on behalf of _Transkribus_ and will inquire 
about the availability of the model. This information will be shared with the Board and 
the group will continue to work toward handwriting support in ALTO. The meeting wrapped 
up after 3 hours, many thanks to all involved.
