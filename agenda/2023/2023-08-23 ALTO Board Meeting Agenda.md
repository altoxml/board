# 2023-08-23 ALTO Board Meeting Agenda
1. Welcome [**All**]
2. Find and tell a non-offensive, maybe self-deprecating joke before the meeting begins and/or after it ends. [**All**]
3. Topics to discuss:

    * Major feature proposal for 5.0: in preparation please provide on github at least one topic/idea to be discussed. Few direction we may explore:
         * How to better support handwritten materials
         * Better support for atypical materials: music scores, scietific books (mathematics, chemistry, physics, electonics, engineering, etc.), old registers with records (commercial, civil, etc), comics, etc.
         * Support for presentation systems that support editing of text information (keep original and edited text maybe)
         * Any other idea, no matter how strange it may sound

4. Other business. [**All**]
