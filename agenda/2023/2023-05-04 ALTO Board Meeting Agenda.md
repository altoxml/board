# 2023-05-04 ALTO Board Meeting Agenda
1. Welcome [**All**]
2. Find and tell a non-offensive, maybe self-deprecating joke before the meeting begins and/or after it ends. [**All**]
3. Topics to discuss:
    
    * Next major version 5.0 - there are several issues that require a major version: 
      * Restrict PointsType to a well defined format (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/80) - implement restrictions defined in  (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/49)
      * Use of LC xlink instead of w3c xlink fails in mixed validation. Mixup/clashes in schema definitions (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/67) - remove xlink, announced on schema 4.4
      * Restrict float attribute values where possible to allow for better xml-validation (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/62) - discuss all similar cases and break it down to multiple topics if needed
      * Deprecate and then remove ZORDER/IDNEXT since from 4.3 we have a different mechanism for order (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/82) 
      * CC attribute to be deprecated (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/72)

4. Major feature proposal for 5.0:		

    * Probably might be good to have something related to handwritten encoding in ALTO - we are still into ideas collection phase
    * Other proposals
 
5. Face-to-face meeting new proposal: probably ICDAR 2023, San Jos√©, US 21-26 August 2023 [**All**]

    * Intention is to make it a hybrid meeting so that everybody can attend
    * Decision should be made by 15th of June

6. Other business. [**All**]
