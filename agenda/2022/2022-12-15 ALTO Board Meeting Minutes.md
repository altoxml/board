# 2022-12-15 ALTO Board Meeting Agenda
1. Welcome [**All**]
2. Find and tell a non-offensive, maybe self-deprecating joke before the meeting begins and/or after it ends. [**All**]
3. Follow up last meeting topics:
    
  * Voting situation for ALTO schema 4.4 proposals: 
    * Support for script in addition to language (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/70) - voting (propose to close)
    * Add LANG and ROTATION attributes to Page element (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/55) - voting (proposed changes available on https://github.com/altoxml/schema/pull/77)
    * Storing detected languages (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/66) - voting (proposed changes available on https://github.com/altoxml/schema/pull/77)
    * Expand schema documentation for PointsType (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/49) - still open
  * Proposals for ALTO schema 5.0
    * Restrict float attribute values where possible to allow for better xml-validation (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/62) - still open - propose for 5.0 due to back compatibility issues)
    * Restrict PointsType to a well defined format (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/80) - implementation itself
    * Use of LC xlink instead of w3c xlink fails in mixed validation. Mixup/clashes in schema definitions (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/67) - remove xlink more feedback needed

  * ALTO schema 4.4 release proposal (time frame)
  * Handwritten documents and ALTO encoding - how to make ALTO more suitable for such documents - ideas (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/81) - topics proposals
