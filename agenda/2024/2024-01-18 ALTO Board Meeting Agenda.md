# 2024-01-18 ALTO Board Meeting Agenda
1. Welcome [**All**]
2. Find and tell a non-offensive, maybe self-deprecating joke before the meeting begins and/or after it ends. [**All**]
3. Topics to discuss:
    * Voting for proposed solution for opened points (changes available on individual branches on git-hub) 
      * Use of LC xlink instead of w3c xlink fails in mixed validation. Mixup/clashes in schema definitions (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/67) - remove xlink, announced on schema 4.4
      * Restrict PointsType to a well defined format (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/80) - implement restrictions defined in  (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/49)
      * Deprecate and then remove ZORDER/IDNEXT since from 4.3 we have a different mechanism for order (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/82) 
      * CC attribute to be deprecated (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/72)
    * Most important change - decide the direction (force xsd 1.1 validation for 5.0, or impleent partially issue 62)
      * Restrict float attribute values where possible to allow for better xml-validation (https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/62)  
4. Major feature proposal for 5.0:
    * Topics proposed:
      * Text on line level, not only on string level 
      * Enriching ALTO with more details domain specific (mathematical formula description, music scores, electronic schemas, chemical formulas)
      * Illustration descriptions (maybe automatically illustration tagging)
    * Any new idea is welcomed!  
5. Face-to-face meeting new proposal: probably ICDAR 2024, Athens, Greece, September 2024?
6. Memberships expired end of 2023 - intention to continue/stop
7. ALTO Chair - two years mandate expired - extend/new candidates 
8. Other business. [**All**]
